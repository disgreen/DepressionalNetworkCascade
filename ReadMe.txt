The Python 2.7 file DepressionalNetworkv2142023 (last updated Febreaury 14, 2023) contains the Depression and Depressional Network classes for 
constructing depressional networks from provided depressional attribute data, as described in Green and Crumpton (2023).

The Python 2.7 file ExampleNetworkRun provides an example of how the Depression and Depressional Netowkr classes can be used to construct a depressional
network from provided data, simulate the routing of precipitation through the network, and calculate some depressional network properties, as listed and discussed
in Green and Crumpton (2023).

The file ExampleNetworkDepressionData.txt contains the depressional morphology data for the example network featured in Figure 3 in Green and Crumpton (2023).
The file ExampleNetworkJoinTable.txt contains the network connectivity data for the example network featured in Figure 3 in Green and Crumpton (2023).
